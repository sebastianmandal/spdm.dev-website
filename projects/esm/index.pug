        h1#header Discord "EasyServerManagement" bot
        h2#header I developed this bot to simplify the process of managing a Discord server/guild. It is a "command line" (chat) tool which allows you to write simple commands to perform actions in your server. The source code for my bot is available at #[a(target="https://github.com/sebastianmandal/easyservermanagement/") https://github.com/sebastianmandal/easyservermanagement].
